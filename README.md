## Where I've Worked...

* [CWT]() -- Add a link and description (like "Worked with a great team that innovated in the R, Shiny, Big Data arenas and liked it!")
* Medtronic
* LarsonAllen (now CLA)
* NSP (now Xcel Energy)

## What I've Enjoyed...

* Making Excel do things my colleagues didn't think possible (like, Push2PPT)
* Learning about Linux (bash) and how to get Hadoop/Hive to work
* Writing (and trying to simplify) crazily complex Shiny apps using R

## My Favorite Apps...

* Client key lookup (Shiny app using rpivottable)
* Third-party data validator (Shiny app that takes data in Excel or CSV and checks it before converting it to a standard format for loading into the company database)
* Client deliverables dashboard (making all the views our consultants use available in a single Shiny app that lets them explore the best way to present data to their clients)
