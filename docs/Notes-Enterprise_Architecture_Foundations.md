# Course Title: Enterprise Architecture Foundations

**Description:** You don’t need an engineering background to craft a winning business strategy. But since modern organizations rely on software systems to help them grow and scale, business leaders also need tech-savvy professionals on deck to help craft a technology strategy that pairs well with their company’s goals. This is where enterprise architecture (EA)—the practice and collection of skills used to align technology and business strategies—comes in. In this course, Dave Swersky breaks down an enterprise architect’s role in an organization, what a career in EA looks like, and how to integrate EA in your organization. Learn what differentiates an architect from a senior or lead developer; how application, solution, and enterprise architects differ; how to create an EA organization; and more.

0:00:25         |   Architects consult with management to help define and document business architecture. Business architecture is the strategy and business process of an enterprise. Having a defined business architecture allows management to prioritize work, as some processes may be more important than others. Solutions designs are aligned to business architecture to define solution scope. 
0:00:48         |   The desire of the business to reduce operating costs is the business strategy. The job of an architect is to plan and design the modifications, and new systems required to realize the strategy. The next step is to design a blueprint based on the business strategy. Let's take a look returning to our example. Once this level of detail is agreed to, architects would then drill down into more detail, documenting the design and architectural decisions made along the way. This process would ideally engage engineering teams to get early feedback on design choices. As the work progresses, architects continue to consult. If the engineering teams discover problems that require a change of plan, the architect will review the change, approve it, and update the design. 
0:01:40         |   Architects construct technology roadmaps, also called landscapes, to express the longterm evolution of an enterprise solution portfolio. Roadmaps include representations of the solutions supported by the enterprise and the technology that supports those solutions. EA departments use roadmaps to accommodate strategic needs, typically planning ahead for 12 to 18 months. 
0:02:11         |   Running an EA department includes administrative tasks, such as hiring and training. Architectural peer review of application and solutions designs is conducted by architectural review boards. IT governance and compliance programs are commonly run by EA to ensure that systems are developed in alignment with enterprise standards.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:09         |   Architects think differently from developers about solving problems. It's helpful to think about it this way. Developers solve technology problems with software. Architects solve business problems with solutions. Developers build applications to a specification to solve problems with a narrowly-defined scope. The goal of developers is to create applications that do one or a very few related things well. Architects, by contrast, focus broadly on business domains filled with tens, sometimes hundreds of applications. You could say that developers plant the trees and architects manage the forest. 
0:00:58         |   The first job of an architect is to cut through that uncertainty by asking the right probing questions. The right questions lead to answers that satisfy the concerns of all stakeholders, including business and IT staff. The job of an architect begins and ends with communication. Remember, business experts typically aren't technologists. They know how to run their business, but they don't necessarily know much about IT systems. It's the architect's job to investigate business requirements, understand business strategy, then frame solution proposals in terms that make sense to both business and technical stakeholders. 
0:01:53         |   At a company with no architects, business users interact directly with developers, so everything is treated as a software problem. Architects are skilled at asking the right questions that drive to purpose and intent. They help keep focus on efforts that drive business value, avoiding distractions. When business users ask for new systems and features, architects help them express what they need in terms of real business outcomes. Writing code is not the only solution to many problems. On the contrary, custom software should be reserved for only the most important business processes, those that differentiate the company from its competitors. Sometimes, problems can be fixed with process changes. Sometimes they can be fixed with a conversation. When software is needed, architects will look to existing resources to see if they can be re-tasked to fill the need. This approach to problem-solving makes the best use of the company's resources.

Note Time:      |   Note Text:                     
--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:00         |   There are three major architectural scopes. Application, solution, and enterprise. 
0:00:05         |   Application architecture is closest to the software development process. Also known as technical architecture, it deals with detailed systems designs. IT systems are composed of a selection of platforms, reusable software components, and paid and open source software. 
0:01:12         |   The architectures of all these applications are defined by application architects. These architects document the architectural designs of new systems, track changes to the designs, and serve as subject matter experts of the architectures. 
0:01:40         |   Application architects must stay involved in the ongoing development of applications to ensure that they're built according to the intended architectural design. Changes to development plans must be reviewed and documented by an architect. 

### Video: Solution architecture

Note Time:      |   Note Text:                     
--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:15         |   When applications work together to solve business problems, you just see the elegance of individual pieces working together. This is what we call a solution. A solution can be defined as a group of related, integrated applications that support business capabilities. 
0:00:23         |   Solution architects do the fitting and coordinating to create the solution. They do the work of plugging systems together to handle complex business workflows. They also focus on the space between these solutions, known as systems integration. Application architects, for their part, design applications so that they can be integrated with other systems. Solution architects then connect the systems together when needed. 
0:00:48         |   Spending time helicoptering between application and enterprise-level scopes is common for this role. You have to be a sort of jack of all trades, focusing narrowly on individual applications and then expanding when needed to broader technical and strategic concerns. Solution architects are in a great position to connect the technical and strategic perspectives. 
0:01:54         |   Another key role of a solution architect is to keep the project aligned to standards, at least as much as possible. When there must be a departure from standards, the justification should be documented and presented the EA team and the architecture review board.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:29         |   Application architects deal with the design of an application, not whether to build that application. Solution architects are concerned with how to support the business capabilities with a solution, not whether the business should support that capability. Enterprise architects work with executives to make strategic decisions. Essentially, do we build or buy? What is the ROI on a technology decision? What are the capabilities in which we should invest? The answers to these questions come from a collaboration between the business and Enterprise architecture. 
0:01:17         |   One of the ways to manage the complexity of applications in a large company is to store information about applications in an Enterprise Architecture Management System, or EAMS. The EAMS can be used to track applications and the platforms that support them. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architect_(software) 
0:02:02         |   Major Enterprise wide initiatives may include investigations into continuous improvement, adopting Agile development or taking up DevOps across the entire Enterprise.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:30         |   If you are a software engineer with an interest in architecture, ask yourself, how much do you depend on that heads-down coding time? Will you be happy with more interaction with others? Will you be satisfied engaging with problems of broader scope? Don't get me wrong, as an architect, you don't suddenly stop being technical. Your technical skills are just put to different uses, like communicating technical things to non-technical people. 
0:01:37         |   Architects need to be impartial judges of technical methods and strategy. You make holistic recommendations based on the needs of your enterprise without being prejudiced by your own direct experience. We all tend to focus on a fairly narrow technical stack to get things done, and that's a good thing. As an architect, however, you're a generalist. 
0:02:04         |   There are four general areas of work where you might find yourself already well-suited to the role. 1) First, are you versed in a wide range of technologies and methods? Architects need a broad set of experience to have perspective on the pros and cons of this framework or that methodology. 2) Second, are you a polyglot dev or do you stick to one language? Challenge your comfort zone. Learn an additional language or a new framework. Add new tools to your problem-solving toolbox. 3) Third, as a developer, are you in a formal or de facto leadership role? Do other developers look to you to find creative solutions to difficult problems? This is another mark of a potential architect, solving problems that are not well-defined. 4) And finally, do you enjoy helping people understand technology?

### Video: TOGAF

Note Time:      |   Note Text:                     
--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:01         |   The Open Group Architecture Framework, [TOGAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework) is a framework for developing enterprise architectures. It was originally developed in the early 1990s based on a U.S. Department of Defense framework called [TAFIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFIM). 
0:00:32         |   The three major parts of TOGAF are architecture domains, the architecture development method, and the enterprise continuum. 
0:00:41         |   TOGAF breaks enterprise architectures into four architecture domains: business, data, application, and technical domains. 
0:00:50         |   The business domain involves business organization, strategy, and process (technology agnostic). 
0:00:59         |   The data domain includes all data assets, data architecture includes data management, migration, and governance. 
0:01:07         |   The application domain deals with descriptions of individual systems and systems integrations. The focus of this domain is not just about computer systems but more broadly on capabilities that manage the data defined in the data architecture. 
0:01:20         |   Finally, the technical domain covers the low-level system components such as hardware, software, and networking. 
0:01:33         |   TOGAF is best known for the Architecture Development Method or ADM, a methodology for producing enterprise architectures The ADM is cyclical and iterative, the ADM is not designed to be used as is, it's a generic framework that is designed to be adapted. EA teams make the ADM their own by deciding specifically how to execute each phase. No two implementations of TOGAF by two different enterprises are the same. 
0:01:59         |   The diagram of the ADM shows the architecture development process starting with a prelim. Each circle represents a phase, the phases are executed along the order of the arrows from A to H, each phase produces artifacts that are used by later phases to inform their artifacts. For example, the materials produced in the Vision phase are used to guide the decisions made in the Business Architecture phase and all the other phases that follow. You can see that each circle has a bi-directional arrow leading to the Requirements Management phase at the center. As the major phases are completed, the Requirements Management phase is used repeatedly to validate and govern the evolution of requirements documentation. 
0:02:40         |   TOGAF calls for the use of a collection of architectural artifacts and material called the Enterprise Continuum. A continuum is a type of progression. The Enterprise Continuum is a collection of documents and information that progresses from generic architectural patterns called foundation architectures, through more specific models leading to enterprise specific models that are used to build real systems. The Enterprise Continuum typically takes the form of an architectural repository which is an organized library of documents that are used as the basis for new architectures. It also stores records of newly developed architectures and information about the activity of the EA team. The architecture repository contains information such as reference architectures, minutes from architecture review meetings, and architecture designs and diagrams. 
0:03:28         |   Before you start using TOGAF, your company may require you to become certified, there are two levels of TOGAF certification. The level one foundation certification demonstrates knowledge and understanding of essential TOGAF terminology and concepts. The level two certification ensures that a candidate can apply TOGAF to a set of business problems.

0:00:58         |   The Zachman Framework is an ontology that is used to organize, categorize, and share knowledge used to build IT systems. The Zachman Framework is named for John Zachman, who developed it at IBM beginning in the early 1980s. Zachman developed the framework in an attempt to develop a formal, codified method for classifying architectural knowledge. 
0:01:29         |   The columns of the Zachman Framework are communication interrogatives. What? How? Where? Who? When? And why? These simple questions define one part of the data that is entered at each joining of row and column. The rows of the Zachman Framework represent perspectives. They are numbered from top to bottom with the executive row as row one (then Business Management, Architect, Engineer, Technician) and the enterprise view as row six. The idea is that as knowledge is added to a column, the lower numbered rows add constraints to the higher numbered rows.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:12         |   Before Agile, there was Waterfall (Gather requirements, Vetting process, Agreement, Programming, System) 
0:01:58         |   Agile methods to software development, such as scrum and kanban are quite different from waterfall. Collaboration between roles in cross-functional teams is highly encouraged. Documentation is useful, but only enough to cover work being done, nothing more. Perhaps most importantly, requirements are kept to a minimum. They are documented but only just enough to guide active development. The development process is cyclical, broken into short sprints of two to three weeks. This method provided the flexibility and collaboration missing from the waterfall method. 
0:02:41         |   The Scaled Agile Framework, known as SAFe, is used by large enterprise to scale agile practices for very large projects and teams. SAFe incorporates concepts of agile architecture in a system called the architectural runway.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:00:56         |   There are several industry recognized ITSM frameworks. Let's get a quick overview of a few. The Information Infrastructure Technology Library or ITIL is one of the best known industry standards for ITSM. ITIL is comprised of five separate publications, Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operation, and Continual Service Improvement. Collectively, these publications describe a phased approach to developing IT services based on best practices developed over decades. 
0:01:31         |   The Service Design publication describes the development and management of a Service Catalog. The Service Catalog describes all the services provided by the IT department. Consumers of IT services within an enterprise use the Service Catalog to find and use those services.

--------------- | -----------------------------
0:02:17         |   EA teams spend much of their time producing materials and artifacts for stakeholder consumption. As such, it's essential to develop examples of artifacts for each stakeholder to make sure that it contains the type of information they want to see, in a format they can understand. 
0:02:35         |   Executive artifacts should present the enterprise in a top-down generalized view, organized by business capabilities. Include visual mappings between solutions, business capabilities, and processes. The level of detail should be fairly coarse-grained, but of course, defer to your executives for the level of detail they want to see.
