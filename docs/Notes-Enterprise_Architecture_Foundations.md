# Course Title: Enterprise Architecture Foundations

**Description:** You don’t need an engineering background to craft a winning business strategy. But since modern organizations rely on software systems to help them grow and scale, business leaders also need tech-savvy professionals on deck to help craft a technology strategy that pairs well with their company’s goals. This is where enterprise architecture (EA)—the practice and collection of skills used to align technology and business strategies—comes in. In this course, Dave Swersky breaks down an enterprise architect’s role in an organization, what a career in EA looks like, and how to integrate EA in your organization. Learn what differentiates an architect from a senior or lead developer; how application, solution, and enterprise architects differ; how to create an EA organization; and more.

0:00:25         |   Architects consult with management to help define and document business architecture. Business architecture is the strategy and business process of an enterprise. Having a defined business architecture allows management to prioritize work, as some processes may be more important than others. Solutions designs are aligned to business architecture to define solution scope. 
0:00:48         |   The desire of the business to reduce operating costs is the business strategy. The job of an architect is to plan and design the modifications, and new systems required to realize the strategy. The next step is to design a blueprint based on the business strategy. Let's take a look returning to our example. Once this level of detail is agreed to, architects would then drill down into more detail, documenting the design and architectural decisions made along the way. This process would ideally engage engineering teams to get early feedback on design choices. As the work progresses, architects continue to consult. If the engineering teams discover problems that require a change of plan, the architect will review the change, approve it, and update the design. 
0:01:40         |   Architects construct technology roadmaps, also called landscapes, to express the longterm evolution of an enterprise solution portfolio. Roadmaps include representations of the solutions supported by the enterprise and the technology that supports those solutions. EA departments use roadmaps to accommodate strategic needs, typically planning ahead for 12 to 18 months. 
0:02:11         |   Running an EA department includes administrative tasks, such as hiring and training. Architectural peer review of application and solutions designs is conducted by architectural review boards. IT governance and compliance programs are commonly run by EA to ensure that systems are developed in alignment with enterprise standards.
