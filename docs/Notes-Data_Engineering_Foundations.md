# [Data Engineering Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-engineering-foundations)

**Description:** Data science can be generally defined as the process of making data useful, and data engineering is a key part of how and why. If you think of data science like a race car, the data engineers are the pit crew. They’re not driving the car, but they make the car much easier to drive. Data engineers make sure the data flow is running smoothly, monitor systems, anticipate problems, and repair the data pipeline whenever problems arise. They extract and gather data from multiple sources and load it into a single, easy-to-query database. In short, data engineers make data scientists’ lives easier.In this course, Harshit Tyagi explains the fundamentals of data engineering. He covers key topics like data wrangling, database schema, and developing ETL pipelines. He also details several data engineering tools like Hive, Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow. By the end of this course, it should be abundantly clear why the data engineer is one of the most valuable people in a data-driven organization.

0:01:39         |   Definition:  data engineering is a type of software engineering that focuses on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining architectures, such as databases and large-scale processing systems. 
0:01:53         |   Skills and knowledge: Linux (comfortable using the command line); programming (Python or Scala or Java); SQL (write queries, extract data, create database schemas); understanding of distributed systems in general and how they are different from traditional storage and processing systems; deep understanding of the ecosystem (including ingestion, processing frameworks and storage engines); know the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and what it is best used for; how to access and process data.
